  "descriptionHTML": "<p>Hibou Bijou is a boutique jewelry studio specializing in looks for the modern woman. The brand design for Hibou Bijou reflects the clean and modern sensibilities of their clients: women who are sophisticated and smart, adventurous and strong.</p><p>The logo is built around a lovely sans serif typeface, Mostra Nuova, whose design was inspired by Italian art deco posters of the 1930s. This gives the logo a tailored and modern feel. It also subtly nods to the meaning of Hibou Bijou: Jeweled Owl. The secondary logos reinforce the art deco feel of the brand.</p>",
